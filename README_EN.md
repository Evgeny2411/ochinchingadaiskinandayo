The learning materials collected for the [日本語 project](https://t.me/daigaku_lounge) can be found here.

We have written down the [introductory info and self-study recommendations](LINK) approved by the majority of the chatters who had enjoyed success in learning Japanese. Moreover, there is a [sizeable amount of resource links](LINK) for 3rd party tutorials, methods, dictionaries, language corpora, and much more potentially useful study stuff.
